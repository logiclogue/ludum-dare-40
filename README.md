## Plan

-
    - Render the coin in the world
    - Update person to use position
    - Collision

- Create a name for the game
-
    - Implementing moving backwards
    - Make moving sideways smoother (implement angular velocity)
-
    - Create a menu
- Level switching
-
    - Create a sprite sheet
    - Create a gulp plugin which will transform the sprite sheets into JSON
    - Update the grass so that it has 3dness

## Ideas

- "The more you have, the worse it is"

- Collect money
- Wealth counter instead of health
- Thieves will steal money away from you
- Tax man will take money away from you
- Beggars who will follow people with money around
- Attack people to get money (by doing so, you'll become a thief)
- Police will put thieves in prison

- Need to collect enough money to escape
