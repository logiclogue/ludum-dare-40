## Plan

-
    - Fix direction for the player moving around
    - Make moving sideways smoother
- Create a name for the game
-
    - Create a sprite sheet
    - Create a gulp plugin which will transform the sprite sheets into JSON
    - Update the grass so that it has 3dness
- Collision
-
    - Create a player inventory
-
    - Create a menu
- Level switching

## Ideas

- "The more you have, the worse it is"

- Something that you collect, which will have a negative side effect
- Monsters (like bunny rabbits, i.e. hop around)
- Every time you kill one of these monsters, they drop things which are bad
- Escape a building which is collapsing
    - Kind of like the end of Ocarina of Time

- Collect money
- More money you have, the more people beg to you
- Need to collect enough money to escape
- Wealth counter instead of health
- People maybe steal money away from you
