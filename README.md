## Plan

-
    - Update the player to have a velocity
    - Update the player to have a vector
    - Create a stream which continuously updates the game logic
    - Update the stream to pipe into the view
    - Update player controls to control the player object
- Create a name for the game
-
    - Create a sprite sheet
    - Create a gulp plugin which will transform the sprite sheets into JSON
    - Update the grass so that it has 3dness
- Collision
-
    - Create a player inventory
-
    - Create a menu
- Level switching

## Ideas

- "The more you have, the worse it is"

- Something that you collect, which will have a negative side effect
- Monsters (like bunny rabbits, i.e. hop around)
- Every time you kill one of these monsters, they drop things which are bad
- Escape a building which is collapsing
    - Kind of like the end of Ocarina of Time
