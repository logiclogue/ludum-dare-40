## Ideas

- "The more you have, the worse it is"

- Collect money
- Wealth counter instead of health
- Thieves will steal money away from you
- Tax man will take money away from you
- Beggars who will follow people with money around
- Attack people to get money (by doing so, you'll become a thief)
- Police will put thieves in prison

- Need to collect enough money to escape
